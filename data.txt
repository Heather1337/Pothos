Monstera Deliciosa|Toxic|Thrives in bright to medium indirect light. Not usually suited for direct sun but can be acclimated to withstand it.|Beginner friendly|Water every 1-2 weeks, allowing soil to dry out between waterings. Increase frequency with increased light.|This plant's leaves gain their famous holes as they mature.|Monstera deliciosa is a species of evergreen tropical vine that is a part of Araceae, the aroid family. Native to the Tropical Americas, it is one of the few aroids which produces edible fruit, hence the species epithet deliciosa. However, it's incredibly rare that a Monstera will flower or produce fruit indoors. Instead, this plant is famous for its beautiful broad green leaves with natural leaf-holes, called fenestrations, which have led to the rise of its nickname, ‘swiss cheese plant’. These holes are theorized to maximize sun fleck capture on the forest floor by increasing the spread of the leaf while decreasing the mass of leaf cells to support.
