Monstera Deliciosa|True|True|Bright indirect to medium light|True|11|Nicknamed the "swiss cheese plant”, the Monstera deliciosa is famous for its quirky natural leaf holes. These holes are theorized to maximize sun fleck capture on the forest floor.|Monstera deliciosa is a species of evergreen tropical vine that is a part of Araceae, the aroid family. Native to the Tropical Americas, it is one of the few aroids which produces edible fruit, hence the species epithet deliciosa. However, it's incredibly rare that a Monstera will flower or produce fruit indoors. Instead, this plant is famous for its beautiful broad green leaves with natural leaf-holes, called fenestrations, which have led to the rise of its nickname, ‘swiss cheese plant’. These holes are theorized to maximize sun fleck capture on the forest floor by increasing the spread of the leaf while decreasing the mass of leaf cells to support.|Water every 1–2 weeks
Philodendron Green|True|True|Bright indirect to low light|True|11|Philodendron is a genus of herbaceous evergreen tropical plants which belongs to the aroid family Araceae|Taxonomically, the genus Philodendron is considered to be a ‘trashbag’ genus because newly-discovered plants that look like philos are placed in this group until they can be further parsed out. This is not uncommon as many aroids tend to look like one another at some point in their life cycle. This particular Philodendron has delicate heart-shaped green leaves and trailing wiry vines.|Water every 1–2 weeks
Snake Plant Laurentii|True|True|Bright indirect to low light|True|18|The Snake Plant Laurentii is a succulent plant characterized by its upright swordlike leaves with vibrant yellow edges.|A multitasker, the snake plant purifies indoor air by removing toxins such as formaldehyde, xylene, and toluene. Native to southern and central Africa, the Sansevieria trifasciata 'Laurentii' is a cultivar of snake plant with yellow variegated edges. Snake plants are tropical plants that are also succulents. Often positioned as low light plants, they are actually medium to bright light plants that tolerate, but not thrive in low light. Like other succulent plants, they have a modified form of photosynthesis, where in order to preserve water, the plant opens its pores exclusively at night. However, since photosynthesis only happens with daylight, the plant stores carbon dioxide acquired at night for use during the day, and releases oxygen (one of the end products of photosynthesis) at night when the pores open. This helps it to maximize efficiency in cleaning the air, as found in study conducted by NASA.|Water every 2–3 weeks
ZZ Plant|True|True|Medium to low indirect light|True|18|The ZZ Plant is characterized by its thick waxy green leaves. It is a great air purifying option that can tolerate low light, making it a perfect plant for beginners.|Zamioculcas zamiifolia, affectionately called the ZZ plant or Zanzibar Gem, is a tropical plant in the aroid family, Araceae. It is native to Zanzibar, Kenya, and Eastern Africa. You might spot large potato-like rhizomes under the surface of its potting mix. Having evolved in drier conditions than most other aroids, these plants have evolved rhizomes that store water to help the ZZ plant survive drought in its natural environment. The rhizomes are actually underground stems, and what you see above ground are the stems' leaves. Using these underground rhizomes, the plant slowly creeps over time to new locations, spawning new aboveground leaves along the way.|Water every 2–3 weeks
Snake Zeylanica|True|True|Bright indirect to low light|True|18|The Snake Plant Zeylanica is a succulent plant characterized by its upright swordlike leaves with green reptile-like variegation.|Native to arid regions of India, Sansevieria zeylanica is a species of snake plant characterized by its dark green variegation. Snake plants are tropical plants that are also succulents. Often positioned as low light plants, they are actually medium to bright light plants that tolerate, but not thrive in low light.

Calathea Rattlesnake|True|False|11|Bright indirect to low light|True|The Calathea Rattlesnake has long wavy green leaves with a pattern of deep green brushstrokes on top, resembling reptile skin, and a deep purple underside.|Calathea lancifolia, the Rattlesnake Calathea, is a colorful member of the prayer plant family, Marantaceae. Calatheas are often called 'prayer plants' because of their unique leaf movements: they raise and lower their leaves from day to night as a part of their circadian rhythm. This phenomenon is called nyctinasty. Plant movements are controlled by a flux of water pressure in the pulvini - nodes at the base of the leaves. Scientists theorize that these movements are meant to follow the sun and catch as much light as possible –– an essential trait for a forest-floor-dwelling plant!|Water every 1–2 weeks

Native to the tropical forests of Brazil, the maranta is most at home in indirect bright light and slightly higher humidity. If your maranta fades in color or becomes washed out, it might be receiving too much direct sun. Marantas (and their family members, calatheas) are often called 'prayer plants' because of their unique leaf movements — they raise and lower their leaves from day to night as a part of their circadian rhythm. This phenomenon is called nyctinasty. Plant movements are controlled by a flux of water pressure in the pulvini (nodes at the base of the leaves).
